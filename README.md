# Tina's Life Planner

A web application for individuals interested in self-growth to visualize their current state in life and concretize their life visions into accomplishable tasks.

I believe everyone can achieve anything they truly desire in life if planning and execution are done right. I built this app to help those who are interested in planning  and achieving their life goals.
